# Lituya Monitor

This is a python package for monitoring systems on Lituya.

# Configuration

Configuration is accomplished through the `/etc/lituyamon.json` config file, which enables setting general vessel parameters, as well as the list of sensors to expose, and logging parameters for the application.

# Current Sensors

## DS18B20 temperature sensors

The DS18B20 temperature sensor is a digital sensor that uses the 1-wire protocol for transmitting data to a digital GPIO port on the RPI.  Each sensor has its own unique digital identifier which is used by the RPI kernel module to organize a set of device files to be read from, which are located in a file `/sys/bus/w1/devices/$DEVICE_ID/w1_slave`, where `$DEVICE_ID` is the identifier of the device used s the directory name.  For Lituya, the five sensors are placed as follows:

- 28-01192d61416d - Fwd Cabin
- 28-01192d3ee042 - Aft Cabin
- 28-01192d62eb82 - Engine Block
- 28-01192d67a561 - Engine Exhaust Elbow
- 28-01192d4fffe6 - Lazarette

Calibrating sensors is done by testing the sensors in ice water and boiling water, and using the following forula:

- CorrectedValue = (((RawValue â€“ RawLow) * ReferenceRange) / RawRange) + ReferenceLow
- example: (((20 - 2) * 100) / 99) + 0 = 18.18

## DHT22 Humidity and Temperature sensors

The DHT22 sensor is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that can can be sampled every two seconds and read off of any GPIO pin. We have two DHT22 sensors that are configured to operate as follows:

- GPIO #27 - Salon
- GPIO #28 - Engine Room

## Raspberry Pi CPU temperature

The RPI has an internal CPU temperature sensor, which we expose.

## MCP3008 A2D Converter

The MCP3008 10-bit analog to digital converter is an IC that uses SPI to communicate with the Raspberry PI and provides 8 pins for analog input. In this project, I wired the chip to use the SPI hardware ports of the pi (although it could have also been set up with software SPI with other GPIO ports). The current analog channels are connected:

- Channel 0: Pin 1 (Channel 0) is connected to a voltage divider that takes the input voltage from the house battery bank and divides it to normalize a maximum voltage value of 18V DC down to a maximum 3.3V as input to channel 0.  This is accomplished using a voltage divider with three resistors: vin -> R1 (100 kohm) -> R2 (22 kohm -> R3 (3.3 kohm) -> GND. The vout is connected between R1 and R2. with this setup, the voltage is divided as (R2 + R3) / (R1 + R2 + R3), which is (22+3.3)/(100+22+3.3), which equals 0.193 time vin.

# Adafruit.IO

Potential site for hosting feed data.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 42, "lat": 23.1, "lon": "-73.3"}'  -H "X-AIO-Key: {io_key}" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{username}/feeds/{feed_key}/data
```

But see the Adafruit IO Pythin library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python

    - `pip install adafruit-io`

Sending data to an IO feed:

```python
# Import library and create instance of REST client.
from Adafruit_IO import Client
aio = Client('YOUR ADAFRUIT IO USERNAME', 'YOUR ADAFRUIT IO KEY')

# Add the value 98.6 to the feed 'Temperature'.
test = aio.feeds('test')
aio.send_data(test.key, 98.6)
```

or in a batch:

```python
# Create a data items in the 'Test' feed.
data_list = [Data(value=10), Data(value=11)]
aio.create_data('Test', data)
```
